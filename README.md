# NetCDF Intensity Splitter

A Python utility for analyzing and segmenting **NetCDF (.cdf)** files based on signal intensity.  
This tool computes a rolling mean of intensity data, determines noise thresholds, identifies signal ranges, exports those ranges as new NetCDF files, and generates a summary plot.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Reads NetCDF datasets containing total intensity and acquisition time.
- Computes a **center-aligned rolling mean** for smoothing.
- Determines noise limits using:
  - Maximum intensity during the first N seconds, or
  - Mean + (factor Ã— standard deviation).
- Detects signal ranges crossing above the noise threshold.
- Exports each range as a **separate in-memory NetCDF file** bundled into a `.zip` archive.
- Generates a **plot of total intensity** with detected ranges marked.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. Loads a NetCDF file (e.g., exported from GC-MS or LC-MS systems).
2. Calculates rolling mean intensity.
3. Determines a noise cutoff using either:
   - `max`: maximum intensity in the first `--noise_sec` seconds.
   - `sd`: mean + `factor Ã— standard deviation` in that same region.
4. Identifies segments where intensity exceeds the noise limit.
5. Writes each detected range to a new `.cdf` inside a single zip file.
6. Outputs a PNG plot visualizing the results.
